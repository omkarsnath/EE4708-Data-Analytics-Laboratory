There are a total of 5 codes attached.

Code 5:
This takes the test set, loads the saved model and outputs the predictions.
It is equivlent to the function that was requested for in the slides.
Just directly run this file to obtain the predictions.

Codes 1-3:
These are the detailed codes of what we have implemented, along with explanations.
Code 1 does preprocessing on the given data to convert into a usable format.
Code 2 imputes the missing data.
Code 3 implements PCA-SVM on the imputed data.

Code 4:
A compact version of Code 3. It creates a Piepline of the same, and saves it using Pickle to then be used by Code 5.


The data files used in the intermediary steps have been uploaded to the following drive:
